Geographic information science (combining amongst other disciplines spatial analysis, geographical information systems and thematic mapping) can support spatial planning in multiple ways. By quantification and measurement it can contribute to increasing our understanding of the spatial phenomena as well as aid in setting goals and assessing policies. In this context, the objective of the laboratory is to facilitate research, via research programs as well as supporting student thesis, focusing on several specific spatial phenomena. Such examples include the monitoring and forecasting of urban sprawl, the establishment and measurement of metrics (urban and regional planning metrics) and also the monitoring and forecasting of land use changes.
